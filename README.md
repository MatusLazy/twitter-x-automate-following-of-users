# Twitter Follow Script
This script allows you to automatically follow a list of Twitter users by running it in your browser console. To use this script, you need to replace the predefined usernames array with your own list of usernames and optionally replace the bearer token.

# Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Logged in to your Twitter account in the browser

# Usage
1. Replace the Usernames Array:
- Update the usernames array with the list of Twitter usernames you want to follow.

2. Replace the Bearer Token (Optional):
- If the default bearer token doesn't work, replace the Bearer token in the headers with your own.

3. Copy and Paste the Script:
- Copy the entire script provided below.

4. Run the Script in the Browser Console:
- Open your Twitter homepage in the browser.
- Open the browser console (press Ctrl+Shift+I or F12 and navigate to the "Console" tab).
- Paste the copied script into the console.
- Press Enter to run the script.

# Notes
- The script includes a 4-second delay between follow requests to avoid triggering rate limits or other restrictions.
- Ensure you are logged in to Twitter in the same browser where you are running this script.
- If you encounter issues with the provided bearer token, you can replace it with your own.
